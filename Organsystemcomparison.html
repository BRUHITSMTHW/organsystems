                <p class="left-p">The circulatory system contains the heart and all veins and arteries. The heart pumps blood throughout the body, which allows nutrients, hormones, and most importantly, oxygen to be reached by cells. The circulatory system also uses this cycle to remove waste from the body in the form of carbon dioxide. The overall job of the circulatory system is to give our bodies' cells access to oxygen.

                <p class="right-p">The respiratory system contains the diaphragm, lungs, and airways in our bodies. The diaphragm contracts to expand the negative space in our chest cavities, which forces air to rush into our lungs to fill the empty space. The lungs then gather the oxygen in the air and transfer it into the bloodstream in little grape-like pockets called "alveoli", which reside at the ends of our bronchiole tubes. The overall job of the respiratory system is to provide oxygen for the cells in our bodies.

They both play different roles to complete the same task, and they work together as a larger system. However, there are many differences between them.
